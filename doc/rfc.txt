1. The Client Send struct message_t to the server
with command equal to the number of this command in command_id enum

enum command_id {
    HELP,
    LOGIN,
    LOGOUT,
    USERS,
    USER,
    SEND,
    MESSAGES,
    SUBSCRIBE,
    SUBSCRIBED,
    UNSUBSCRIBE,
    USE,
    CREATE,
    LIST,
    INFO
};

2. The Client send then the payload that correspond to the command
Exemple:
 
command = USERS

typedef struct cli_users_s {
    char user_uuid[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
} cli_users_t;

3. The Server read the command id and then the corresponding payload

4. The Server compute the action corresponding to the command id

5. The server send back a command id and the corresponding server payload.
In case of error their is also a enum and so the client can identify the type of error.
