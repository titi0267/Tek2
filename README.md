# Epitech second year

This repository contains all of my Epitech's second year project.

## Description

I chose to do all of the projects available during this year to challenge my self.

This was by far the hardest and the most time consuming year that I've done.

It represents all of my work from January 2022 to July 2022 with all of the commits.

### Disclaimer

This work reflects my coding style and practices at the time of its creation.

It may not align with my current approach to writing code.

As I continuously strive to improve and refine my coding techniques, the methodologies and conventions demonstrated in this work may no longer represent my current standards.

### IndieStudio

This is an important project that I extracted into a single repository.

See [Bombitek](https://github.com/titi0267/Bombitek) for more informations.

### Math

These projects didn't forced us to use a specific language, which is why, to challenge ourself's we tried to change the programming language between each projects.

|   Description   | A distinguished nuclear physics researcher and their assistant are studying neutrinos, a kind of promising particle, and are trying to prove that these particles can travel faster than light. Considering the size of the series that were recorded, they need you to develop a software that will allow them to update their data in real-time | The world population growth is a cause for concern for most people: 1 billion people in 1800, 2 billion people in 1927, 6 billion people in 2000 and almost 8 billion people today. . . Predicting future population using past censuses is therefore a key concept. | A power hammer mass produces dowels. Sometimes, some pieces are defective, and the whole process requires quality control: 100 samples of 100 pieces are randomly taken, and defective pieces are numbered. We get what we call an observed serial. Then, a statistical fit is done using the binomial distribution, and validated using the χ2 test. | Several months before an important election, many polls seem to pop up from nowhere. Their interpretations are often surrounded by uncertainty: to what extent are these polls reliable? Why are there so many differences between poll institutes? And from day to day? Is a 3% variation significant? Etc |
